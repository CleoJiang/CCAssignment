probability to win game 1:p
probability to win game 2: p^3+c13*p^2(1-p)
the domain of p is (0,1)

To decide the time to choose different game is to find the game with bigger chance of winning.
We should propose the relation of two probability and find the solution under different value of p.

if p>p^3+c13*p^2(1-p)
p<0.5 or p>1(cut off)
So when p<0.5, we should choose game1
when p>0.5, we should choose game2
When p=0.5, either game has the same chance of winning.
