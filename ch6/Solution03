There is odd number squares in the first row, so we should fill the last square by borrow a square from the second row.
When we fill the second row, its squares number is also odd after borrowed by first row.
 Keep repeating the process, when we fill in the last row, it has nowhere to borrow square to fill its last square.
 So it can't be filled by two-square Dominos.
