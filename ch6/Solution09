 Kth door is toggle on rounds of all its multiply factors including 1 and itself.
 if the toggle number is even, this door remain closed as the initial status.
 if the toggle number is odd, this door will changed to open.
 Our task is to find these doors with odd number multiply factors.

 if we write down the sequence of toggle results. we find that:
 When k is some number's square, it has odd number toggle.
 from 1 to 100, there are 10 such square numbers, so finally, there are 10 doors open.
