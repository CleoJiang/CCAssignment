Use binary integer to give order number to every bottle.
10 digits is enough to represent all 1000 bottles.
There are 10 strips, which could be map to the 10 digits.
Look through every digit of every bottle order number, each time at some digit we saw a 1, add that bottle to the strip
it corresponds.
Finally, we get several strips that change color.
We get a ten digits number: which strip change color, set that digit 1.
The bottle with the same binary integer order is the one which is poisonous.
